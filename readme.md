# Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent
George Zhang, CS227 Final Project (Cynthia Dwork), Harvard University Spring 2017

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to implement and analyze the utility of differentially private algorithms for stochastic gradient descent. 

## To Do
### Main Goals
* Implement data generation script (Done)
* Implement non-private SGD
* Implement private SGD
* Data collection / utility analysis
* Presentation prepared
* Writeup complete

### Secondary Goals
* Visualization of algorithms
* Analysis with regards to theoretical utility
* Multinomial logistic regression?
